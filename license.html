                <div>
                  <p>Licensing is such a complex process, and navigating this process can be really daunting for both
                    financial service
                    providers and banks that need various kinds of licenses to either bring new products to the market,
                    or maintain existing
                    products they already have in the market. The complexity is a result of how diverse the regulatory
                    frameworks are, and
                    the specific requirements for each license type. This often leads to delays, inefficiencies, and
                    errors in submissions.
                    A dedicated feature within the compliance management platform that simplifies each phase, from
                    identifying the right
                    license, to tracking the application post-submission, could significantly streamline the process,
                    reducing common
                    bottlenecks and improving overall efficiency. <br>

                  <p>Months after the License Application went GA, we started seeing impact of the net-new feature via

                  <ul>

                      rejection.</li>
                    <li>- <strong>60% adoption rate</strong> as users find value in the feature.</li>
                  </ul> <br>

                  <p>The project also achieved several notable internal successes, as it got attention of leadership.

                <div>
                  <p><strong>License Application</strong> is the structured process by which organisations, particularly
                    in regulated sectors like finance,
                    seek official authorisation from regulatory bodies to operate specific services or conduct certain
                    activities. This
                    process typically involves selecting the appropriate type of license, gathering and submitting
                    required documentation,
                    and adhering to regulatory guidelines. License applications must often meet stringent standards to
                    ensure compliance
                    with industry regulations, making the process both complex and detail-oriented. <br><br>Effective
                    license
                    application management
                    is crucial for timely approval and operational efficiency, as errors or incomplete submissions can
                    lead to delays,
                    penalties, or even rejections.</p>

                  <p>Several financial institutions face an increasingly complex licensing requirements as regulatory
                    environments evolve,
                    and this makes compliance more challenging and resource-intensive. Building a licensing feature
                    directly within EMTECH
                    compliance management software addresses this need by providing a centralised platform to manage and
                    track licensing
                    applications, simplifying what can often be a fragmented process.</p> <br>

                  <p>This feature would:</p> <br>

                  <ul>
                    <li>- allow financial institutions to efficiently navigate diverse licensing requirements, reducing
                      operational costs
                      associated with manual tracking and compliance errors.</li>
                    <li>- Furthermore, it enhances the software’s value proposition by integrating licensing management
                      with other compliance
                      workflows, giving clients an end-to-end compliance solution that drives both efficiency and
                      accuracy.</li>
                  </ul><br>

                  <p>By investing in a licensing feature, our software positions itself as a comprehensive compliance
                    tool, boosting client
                    satisfaction, retention, and market competitiveness. Our integrated approach not only meets
                    immediate user needs but
                    also opens avenues for future growth as regulatory demands continue to evolve.</p>

                  <p>Being part of the initial research and user interviews with my product partners for the feature, I
                    drafted some customer
                    pain points for the proposed feature.
                  </p> <br>

                  <p>Some pain points includes:</p> <br>


                  <ul>
                    <li>1. Users often struggle with understanding varying licensing requirements across regions or
                      license types.</li>
                    <li>2. Without centralised tracking, users may be left in the dark about their application’s status
                      and next steps.</li>
                    <li>3. Many users manage licensing tasks across various tools and platforms, leading to
                      inefficiencies and potential for
                      oversight.</li>
                    <li>4. Mistakes in application forms or missing documentation often result in costly delays or
                      rejections.</li>

                    <p>In the existing system, we provisioned FSPs with a plethora of frameworks with the assumption
                      what we had would suffice;
                      it was painful because it exempted some FSPs with bespoke frameworks as they could neither create
                      nor insert these
                      bespoke frameworks which they needed to bring onto our platform.</p>
